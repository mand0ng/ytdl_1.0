PYTHON SCRIPT THAT DOWNLOADS FASTER AND BETTER QUALITY THAN USING A FREE WEBSITE YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER 

WHY I MADE THIS SCRIPT

<b>Problem :</b> <br> 
When my sister moved out. They lived in a remote place in PH called Siquijor. Their kids used to watch Youtube Videos and 
unfortunatly they dont have wifi at their new home.


<b>Future Plans: make a simple gui and export it to an exe file</b>
